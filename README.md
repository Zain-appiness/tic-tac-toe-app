## React Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React, inspired by the official React tutorial. This project demonstrates key concepts of React, including components, state management, and event handling.

## Project Description
This project is a React-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows players to take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game results in a tie.

## Features
Interactive gameplay for two players (X and O).
Displays the winner or a tie when the game ends.
Allows users to navigate to previous moves (time travel).
Fully responsive design with support for both light and dark modes.
Clean and modern UI.

## Technologies Used
React: To build the user interface.
CSS: For styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: For game logic and state management.

## Challenges and Future Improvements
Implementing time travel while maintaining a clean state management structure.
Plans to add AI for single-player mode in the future.
